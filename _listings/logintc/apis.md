  description: LoginTC provides a two-factor authentication system that can be used
    with networks, websites, and both mobile and online applications. The system uses
    LoginTC credentials on smartphones in combination with a traditional username
    and password for authentication. This means that a potential hacker would have
    to possess both a user&#039;s password and their smartphone in order to breach
    an account.The LoginTC REST API allows users to perform common administrative
    tasks and to send and check authentication sessions with end-users.
