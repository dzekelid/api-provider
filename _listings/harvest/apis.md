  description: Harvest provides two API interfaces, serving two distinct roles. If
    you need to access and manipulate your daily timesheet the Time Tracking API fits
    the bill. Notable uses of the Time Tracking API are the widgets we provide for
    PC and Mac as well as other third party timesheet software integrations.  If you
    need to access and edit your projects, clients, users and tasks the extended API
    is your choice. You can use this to mass import your existing projects setup,
    add users and generally integrate with your existing back-office setup.
