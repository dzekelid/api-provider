    and gift certificates for appointments through Acuity. Acuity Appointment Scheduling

    users can easily export data, such as client information and appointment schedules,
    from the service. Client information that has been collected can be used to create

    about appointments, revenue, staff, or locations over any time range. Developers
    can interact with their appointment schedule programmatically via REST API.
